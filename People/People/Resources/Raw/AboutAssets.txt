Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
<<<<<<< HEAD
this directory (and child directories). Deployment of the asset to your application
is automatically handled by the following `MauiAsset` Build Action within your `.csproj`.

	<MauiAsset Include="Resources\Raw\**" LogicalName="%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)" />
=======
this directory (and child directories) and given a Build Action of "MauiAsset":

	<MauiAsset Include="AboutAssets.txt" />
>>>>>>> e5d550d (gestion SQLite)

These files will be deployed with you package and will be accessible using Essentials:

	async Task LoadMauiAsset()
	{
		using var stream = await FileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync("AboutAssets.txt");
		using var reader = new StreamReader(stream);

		var contents = reader.ReadToEnd();
	}
